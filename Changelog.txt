Version 1.1:
- Added the Collision Properties Randomiser.
- Add the Physics Prop Randomisation option in the SET Randomiser.
- Replaced the archaic Windows Folder Browser with the nicer Ookii one.
- Fixed a copy and paste error where the Item Capsule Configuration in the SET Randomiser wiped the wrong list.
- Cleaned up some incorrect variable names caused by copy and pasting.
- Made people's names in the About Window link to their GitHub pages where possible.
- Added a Licensing Window to the About Window.
- Switched the License over to MIT (was previously a GPL one, which didn't seem to make sense for this).
- Changed the build mode to a Console Application, so a Command Prompt will accompany the Suite and can display information.
