# Building
To manually build the Randomiser Suite, simply clone this repository to a location on your computer and open `Sonic '06 Randomiser Suite.sln` in Visual Studio (only [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) has been tested for this, but any recent version should be able to compile it). Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and choose Rebuild Solution to build an executable in `..\Sonic '06 Randomiser Suite\bin\Debug`.

If you just wish to use the Manager without touching the code, [simply grab the most recent stable release](https://github.com/Knuxfan24/Sonic-06-Randomiser-Suite/releases).
