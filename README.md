# SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (2006) Randomiser Suite
A small software package designed to randomise various elements in SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (2006) on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 consoles, ranging from random enemy types in levels to random speed values for the characters.

# Building
To manually build the Mod Manager, simply clone this repository to a location on your computer and open the `SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (2006) Randomiser Suite.sln` solution file in Visual Studio (VS2019 recommended, although other versions SHOULD work fine). Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and choose Rebuild Solution to build an executable in `..\SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (2006) Randomiser Suite\bin\Debug`.

# Notes
Things such as bosses can also wreck havoc on the game's already low stability, therefore, use caution when enabling them. Avoid using them on real hardware, as they cause major glitches (as seen here: https://youtu.be/_g_AUWhp6Ls?t=12630).
Only certain characters can do certain actions, for example, only Sonic can do the water surfing in Wave Ocean and only Sonic holding Elise and Silver can use the Swing Vines in Tropical Jungle.
